# Code Challenge
This repo is designed to store every solution made by my own for code challenges that I found in internet. Most of the challenges are taken from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/.

This is a .NET focus repository, so all solutions are coded in C# and lean on unit testing (using XUnit) to guarantee the proper functionality of the code. 
The code hosted in this repo doesn't pretend to be a unique possible solution to the problem neither the most optimal, it's just an approach.
